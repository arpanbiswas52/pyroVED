Colab notebooks
===============

The easiest way to start using pyroVED is via Google Colab, which is a free research tool from Google for machine learning education and research built on top of Jupyter Notebook. The following notebooks can be executed in Google Colab by simply clicking on the "Open in Colab" icon:

*   | Mastering the 1D shifts in spectral data |Shift-VAE|

*   | Disentangling image content from rotations |r-VAE|

*   | Learning (jointly) discrete and continuous representations of data |j(r)-VAE|

*   | Semi-supervised learning from data with orientational disorder |ss(r)-VAE|

*   | im2spec: Predicting 1D spectra from 2D images |im2spec-VED|
