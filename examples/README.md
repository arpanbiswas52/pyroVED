The easiest way to start using pyroVED is via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), which is a free research tool from Google for machine learning education and research built on top of Jupyter Notebook. The following notebooks can be executed in Google Colab by simply clicking on "Open in Colab" icon:
